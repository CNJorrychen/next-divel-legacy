History
=========

NextDivel 0.0.1 was written from scratch, based on James Molloy Kernel Tutorials. There is another repository with the legacy kernel.

NextDivel 0.0.2 will be based on MINIX 3. 


NextAPI
=========

The most important thing in the OS is the NextAPI, while NextDivel 0.0.2 is compatible with POSIX, there is also a more powerfull API to comunicate applications with the system. This API is NextAPI and can be used in GUI, Threads, Clocks, Drivers, Events and more. The NextDivel GUI is based on X11 but with bindings for NextAPI.
